# BIO-head-pose-estimation

Project for biometric systems course at FIT VUT. There are 3 methods implemented:

* Using 3D model of a face and PnP
* Using first frame for initialisation and computing head pose estimation via movement changes
* Using geometry and relationships between anthropometric points
